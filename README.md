ServerUtilities
===============
ServerUtilities for server owners and daring single players. Backport and Rebrand of the 1.12.2 version of FTBUtilities, FTBLibrary, and Aurora for 1.7.10.

Fully backwards compatible with homes, chunks, and warps. These will be loaded from FTBU on first load.

Utilizes a permission system to handle whether a player can use certain commands and do certain things. A full list of permissions along with their description can be dumped using the command `/dump_permissions`, the file will be placed at ``.minecraft/serverutilities/server/``. They can also be viewed using the Aurora webapi.

## Quick Install

Download the latest JAR from [releases](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/ServerUtilities/releases) - you want the one named ServerUtilities-number.jar, not the `dev` or `sources`. Place it in the `/mods` folder on your server AND client (if single player, on client only).

Once loaded, you will find new UI options in your inventory screen:

For single player, loading chunks is the most important, and you can click that icon and then shift-click (and drag) to designate chunks to load. Right click to unload and unclaim.

The ServerUtilities configuration files are found in `.minecraft/serverutilities` and it will migrate from FTBU for you. The most likely thing you want to change is found in `.minecraft/serverutilties/server/ranks.txt` where you can control how many chunks can be loaded. `.minecraft/serverutilities/serverutlities.cfg` is where you can disable backups if you have another backup solution.

For server admins, there is much more that ServerUtilities can do, refer to the FTBU documentation for now.
